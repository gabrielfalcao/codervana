**Zero setup through Github integration**

Codervana integrates with your github account so you don't have to

The members of your existing teams gain Codervana profiles. People can
like and comment on project status updates, full social interaction.

**Notifications**

You get notifications any and every where you want: email, IRC,
jabber, rss feeds and even SMS

**Hotspots**

An attractive and easy list of everything that needs improved:
Everything grouped and organized by classes and methods. You get to
see the affected lines and its surroundings.

**Karma points**

Simple math: a team member that writes bad code loses karma points;
the one who improves it gains karma.

**Duplication Detection**

Fuzzy matching algorithm finds DRY-violations that human reviewers
might miss.

**Start Fixing with One Click**

Full integration with Pivotal Tracker, GitHub Issues, and Lighthouse
lets you open tickets instantly.

**GitHub Integration**

Codervana also comments in the github repositories, every bad line
will get a link back to the codervana stats about it.

**Scoreboard**

Managers get a scoreboard of the developers, which can also be
publicly visible to all of them. It's all one click away.


**Private, Safe, and Secure**

All data is private by default. SSL encryption everywhere.


## Views


**Base view**

Logo, a project switch, profile options and search are always visible
in the project.

**Compare view**

Each commit has a compire view, showing what code was improved and
what code got worse.

It includes:

* Button to open the github issue referred in the commit
* Each bad line chunk of code gets

Tabs:

* Method complexity
* Lack of test coverage
* Code smells
* Duplication

**Feed**

What code got worse when.

A timeline showing what class or method got worse, why and by who.

People comments and likes also go in there.

The right side shows the total project Karma

Churn vs. Quality over time

Breakdown over time

**Dashboard**

A panel with project widgets, one per project showing its karma


**Change alert for TV (individual)**

shows the last person who affected the codebase somehow: either made
worse or improved it. The idea is that everybody will always be
wanting to make it better.

**Change alert for TV (code change itself)**

Shows a BIG alert of what just got changed, either good or bad, just
like for the individual, but without much emphasis on it


**Preferences**

You can set what PEP rules you want to consider bad.
